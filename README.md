# AdventOfCode
All my advent of code, code.

## Day 1
Extremely inefficient. But also quick to code.

## Day 2
Clean looking solution. Uses regex despite how slow regex is. Negligible in small
datasets like this however.

## Day 3
In part 2, I could put them in the same loop, but it would have been less modular.

## Day 4
Converts to pandas dataframe. Could technically do validation as it turns into
a pandas dataframe, but didn't seem necessary. I got the proper answer, but
I am aware that there should be MORE validation checks within each validation
function.

## Day 5
Shabooyah.
