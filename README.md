# AdventOfCode
All my advent of code, code.

## Day 1
Extremely inefficient. But also quick to code.

## Day 2
Clean looking solution. Uses regex despite how slow regex is. Negligible in small
datasets like this however.

## Day 3
In part 2, I could put them in the same loop, but it would have been less modular.
